# Balkan languages

This culture is very roughly described as maqam music shaped by Western influence. The music is modal with scales like phrygian (kurd) or double-harmonic major (hijazkar). Yes it's in 12-tone temperament, as the instruments are fretted strings, brass, accordion. Sometimes droning bases or major/minor triads are used as harmony.
